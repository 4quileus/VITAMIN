#VITAMIN

VITAMIN is an open-source model checker tailored to the verification of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MAS descriptions are given by means of labelled transition systems.
VITAMIN supports a set of specifications, including Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) operators. 

The VITAMIN tool operates on Streamlit, an open-source app framework used for creating web apps. Thus, VITAMIN runs on all architectures (e.g., Linux, Mac, and Windows). 
The tool takes as input:
- A text file representing the model. This file can be manually created by the user, or interactively deployed via VITAMINâ€™s user interface.
- A text box representing the logical formula under exam. Such a text box is part of the graphical user interface.
Then, VITAMIN applies the corresponding model checking algorithm for the chosen temporal logic. 

Currently, VITAMIN supports Concurrent Game Structures (CGSs) as models, and CTL, ATL, and ATLF as specifications. 
The CGS consists of states of the MAS and transitions that are labeled with actions taken by each agent.
